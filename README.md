# JavaFX JAVE GUI Project

A Java project featuring a GUI built with JavaFX and integrated with the JAVE library (a wrapper for FFmpeg).

This project demonstrates:

- A clean and responsive JavaFX interface
- Solid multithreading practices with JavaFX
- Integration of JAVE for audio/video processing using FFmpeg

Originally developed two years ago, this project is now being published for reference and possible future development. The main motivation for publishing is to revisit JavaFX concurrency patterns and share a practical example.

Further updates are not guaranteed but may happen depending on future exploration.
